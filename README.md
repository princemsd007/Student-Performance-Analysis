# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction

This project involves analyzing and predicting student performance using various data science techniques. The aim is to understand the factors influencing student outcomes and develop models to forecast future performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and key insights.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that can improve model performance.
- **Model Building:** Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Prediction:** Predicting student performance based on the developed models.
